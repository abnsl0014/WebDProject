<p>
Sunshine Old Age Home is registered under Society Registration Act 1860 and the Foreign Contributions (Regulation) Act, 1976. Since last 14 years we are providing free shelter, food, clothing, medical care facilities, love and affection to the destitute and abandoned old aged. Most of these elders are picked up from the streets of Delhi NCR or brought in by Police/hospital authorities.Sunshine Old Age Home has saved over 4000 elders in the past 14 years.

With a strong belief that helping old aged people and spreading awareness of elder care would not only give them a new life but also reduce the issue of elder abuse in the society. We believe in the notion of “Vasudeva Kutumbakam” meaning the whole word is our family which inspires us to serve every needy old aged as our own family member..</p>
